==================

W14 Ready! (Brynn Kiefer)

Hangman game with both Command-line and Graphical interfaces.

To run: 
 * CLI version: ant runCLI
 * GUI version: ant runGUI

To use a custom wordlist, use ant argument:
   -Darg0="/filename/"

To play either version, start with either a custom or default word list. Then, guess a letter in the word. Proceed in this manner until either you have exhausted your incorrect guesses or completely guessed the word.
